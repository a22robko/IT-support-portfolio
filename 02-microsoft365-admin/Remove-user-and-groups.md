# Delete Group and User in Microsoft 365

## Delete a Group

### Step 1 – Confirm group deletion  
When deleting a Microsoft 365 group (e.g., a Team), all associated data (conversations, files, notebooks, and calendars) will be removed.

### Step 2 – Group removed from Admin Center  
The deleted group no longer appears in the Admin Center, but it can be restored for up to **30 days**.

## Delete a User

### Step 3 – Confirm user deletion  
When deleting a user, Microsoft 365 asks to review settings like aliases, mailbox access, and OneDrive data transfer.

✅ **Key takeaway**: Both groups and users are retained for **30 days** and can be restored if needed. This ensures accidental deletions can be reversed without data loss.
